******************
The Euclid Project
******************


This project allows Unity3D to interact with the Eclipse IDE.

Prerequisites:

1) Eclipse (http://www.eclipse.org/)
2) Eclim (http://eclim.org/)

You'll need to install both of these.  Then you'll need to edit the EclipseConfig file with the appropriate path to your eclipse installation.

You can look at the EuclidTest scene as an example of how to get started.

You can use Euclid in your own project by importing Euclid.unitypackage.  Note that if you do this, you'll also need to import the packages on which Euclid depends:

1) UShell (https://github.com/srfoster/UShell)
2) Unloader (https://github.com/srfoster/Unloader)

When you have imported all of the necessary packages, you can place the EclipseObject into your scene.  The Eclim server will start when your game starts.  The first time may take several minutes.  Subsequent times will be faster.

You may make calls to the Eclipse IDE by calling functions in Eclipse.cs.  These functions communicate with Eclim, which (in turn) communicates with the Eclise IDE.
